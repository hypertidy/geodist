# Contributing to geodist

## Opening issues

The easiest way to note any behavioural curiosities or to request any new
features is by opening a [github issue](https://github.com/hypertidy/geodist/issues).


## Development guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to `geodist`, we use [the GitHub
flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for proposing,
submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you haven't done this before,
there's a nice overview of git [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html), as well
as best practices for submitting pull requests
[here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#pr-make).


## Code of Conduct

We want to encourage a warm, welcoming, and safe environment for contributing to
this project. See the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/hypertidy/geodist/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) for
more information.
